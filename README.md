I found out that programming is fun only when you know what you're doing, otherwise you are wasting your time and your self-esteem will take some hits. It is frustrating sometimes, precisely when you are stuck with a problem for days, weeks, but eventually if you stay with it, you will find even greater satisfaction when you finally solve it. So, stay with it!
